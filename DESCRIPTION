Description: Access to the MBTA's performance API for R. Creates an easy-to-use
  bundle of functions to work with all the built-in calls to the MBTA performance 
  API, and some to work with the GTFS-compatible API V3 which replaced some 
  functionality from the old performance API. Allows users to download realtime 
  tracking data in dataframe format that is manipulable in standard R analytics 
  functions. Pulls performance statistics in both realtime and for historical 
  dates and trips (after July 2015).
